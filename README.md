As a person whose lungs have been effected by COVID-19, me and m family had to submit the lung scan to the doctor and wait for his response to confirm if it was COVID 19 or just a viral fever. This was also a time where the COVID 19 cases were blowing up in India and we have difficulties finding a doctors appointment and hospital beds. Using AI/ML we can find a way to easily classify if a patient has COVID 19 or not based upon the scanning images.

Tl;dr:Image classification using VGG16 and prediction using new images which the model has not seen.
